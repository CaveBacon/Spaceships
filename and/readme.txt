Common hidden layer neuron count is in the range ( -A / sqrt(N) , A / sqrt(N) ) , where N is number of inputs, and A is a constant 2 or 3.  This helps elimiinate saturation.

Typical learning rate is between 0.05 <= n <= 0.75 ( 0.1 is common , its also common to scale the learning rate relative to the training set )
Typical Momentum is 0 <= a <= 0.9
